# RealmStat
### A RotMG packet capture tool

Thanks to [X-com](https://github.com/X-com) for their work on RealmShark and everyone else credited there. \
This is essentially a ground up rebuild of RealmShark's packet capture and decryption features. \
As of right now this just captures and decrypts packets, but more is planned if I feel like it. \
Hopefully I'll find the motivation to make this useful.

## Download
Download and install [npcap](https://npcap.com/#download). \
Find the Windows installers and a standalone executable in [releases](https://github.com/wowjack/realm-stat/releases). \
Support for Mac and Linux is being worked on.
