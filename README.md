# RealmStat
### A RotMG packet capture tool

Thanks to [X-com](https://github.com/X-com) for their work on RealmShark and everyone else credited there. \
This is essentially a ground up rebuild of RealmShark's packet capture and decryption features. \
As of right now this just captures and decrypts packets, but more is planned if I feel like.
